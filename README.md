# Trie Demo

tl;dr - I briefly looked up what a trie was, and upon a reading one sentence, I decided to implement one without referencing any documentation or reading best practices. I hope to demonstrate my ability to handle ambiguously in software engineering challenges. I also ended up spending a lot of time on the UI for this project.

See the UI and a live implementation of this trie search linked [here](https://akambale.github.io/trie/).

## Some companies are bad at front-end interviewing

Specifically, companies who decide to quiz their candidates with CSS and JavaScript trivia during an onsite interview (at least in my opinion; if you are a company considering interviewing me and you do these types of interviews, don't take my criticism personally haha. I'll still do your interview).

I understand the purpose of this, it's a good way to gauge a candidates front-end experience and the speed in which they can build UIs. If you are an agency like Triplebyte where you need to initially screen candidates by skill, that makes perfect sense. But if you are a company following the regular interview process, you can accomplish this by just reading a candidate's resume and asking them questions about their previous projects during a phone screen. Furthermore, it doesn't account for the fact that every candidate has developed different competencies based on the problems they have had to solve in their work.

A few months ago, in an onsite interview, I was asked the following question:

**Interviewer:** "Imagine you are building Google's search page. How do you update search results when the user changes their input?"

**Me:** "Make another request to the server with the new search string"

**Interviewer:** "But that's pretty slow, how do we show the user feedback right away?"

**Me:** _shrugs_

**Interviewer:** "Well, we can save an extra amount of potential search data from the first query. For example, if the user input start with the letter a, we can send all search phrases to the client that start with the letter a."

**Me:** "Oh that makes sense, then as they update the search input, we can further filter from our previously fetched search phrases"

I was annoyed by the question. My first and second engineering jobs were at data companies where the most critical thing was manipulating and displaying data. I never needed to build a search functionality where performance was critical to the UX. Besides, if I had built Google's search page, I wouldn't be here interviewing at your company, Iâ€™d be drinking moon juice with President Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

## What the heck is a trie?

I was reading over a guide to preparing for coding interviews and the author mentioned a "trie." I thought this person was rather bad at spelling, but just to be sure, I web-searched the phrase and found the following definition:

_A trie is a tree-like data structure whose nodes store the letters of an alphabet. By structuring the nodes in a particular way, words and strings can be retrieved from the structure by traversing down a branch path of the tree._

A light bulb went off; this is the answer my previous interviewer was fishing for! Of course I would have said to use a trie if I had known about this data structure. If the companies I interview with continue to interview me in the form of pop-quiz, I'll be doomed in my job search.

After lamenting this frustration to an engineer with more interviewing experience, he reminded me that there is an impossible number of things you can try to study up on for interviews. When you don't know an answer during an interview, the best thing to do is talk about how you would handle this situation on a job.

Inspired by this, I figured I'd try to build a trie demo from scratch. To add some additional ambiguity and challenge, I thought to try this without knowing any more about tries aside from the one web-search I had done above.

## Constructing The Trie

I was a bit surprised that it took me a few hours to get the trie class working. I had the basic structure outlined quickly. See below:

```
TrieNode {
    this.value
    this.isWord
    this.addChild = function(){
      this[nextLetter] = new TrieNode()
    }

    this.a = TrieNode {}
    this.b = TrieNode {}
    this.c = TrieNode {}
    ...
}
```

Writing the constructor function and addChild function proved to be tricker than expected. I am good at thinking recursively, but the number of child nodes a trie generates is gratuitous. Once I solved for that, and handled the edge case of initializing the original parent node with an empty value, the code was good to go! See it in `trie.js`. Here is an example of the trie with a few simple inputs:

Input of "an"

```
{
  val: "",
  isWord: false,
  a: {
    val: "a",
    isWord: false,
    n: {
      val: "an",
      isWord: true
    }
  }
}
```

And the same tree after adding an input of "a" as well as "and"

```
{
  val: "",
  isWord: false,
  a: {
    val: "a",
    isWord: true,
    n: {
      val: "an",
      isWord: true
        d: {
          val: "and",
          isWord: true
        }
    }
  }
}
```

## Searching

To truly demo the trie, I needed to create a search suggestion function; a method that would take your partial search string and suggest possible words you may be trying to type out. I wrote the method `trieLogSearch` as seen in`search.js`. It finds the node in the trie which matches the search input, and then recurses down all the child nodes finding valid words as search results.

To contrast, I also wrote `linearSearch` also found in `search.js`. This method loops through the dictionary array and determines if the partial search strings matches the first few characters of that word. If so, it adds it to the search results.

When the user searches, they'll receive search results from `trieLogSearch`. But both search methods are invoked sequentially and their performance is compared and displayed at the bottom of the results.

## The UI

Since this project was inspired by trying to imitate the live search on the Google home page, I though I'd copy the style of the logo and search bar. But what was supposed to be a simple UI demo the project turned into a full Google homepage clone. If the scope of the project had always been as large, I would have opted to use React and SCSS.

But since I started with Vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML, I stuck with and built the website like it was 2008! It was a fun exercise in raw DOM manipulation and a reminder of how the core APIs work. The cons of this method is that code organization tends to get a bit messy. I did my best to follow BEM for CSS and try to name my JS methods intuitively. The project is just small enough that you can still follow the code.

Check out a live implementation of this trie search linked [here](https://akambale.github.io/trie/). You can load the 10K most common words in the english language according to google [(shamelessly stolen from this repo)](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english) into a trie and try searching it. Or, create your own trie in the console!
