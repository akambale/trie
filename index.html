        <p>
          A trie (pronounced the same as tree) is a data structure that makes
          searching for words faster. If that was too much computer science
          jargon, try this metaphor. Imagine I gave you a list a of 10,000 words
          in the order of their frequency. For example, the words <i>the</i>,
          <i>a</i>, <i>of</i> are near the top of the list. Whereas the word
          <i>among</i> is somewhere around 450 words into the list.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I then told you to find the word <i>scholar</i>, you would have no
          idea where to start. Your best method is to probably skim the list
          word for word until you find <i>scholar</i>. This method is
          inefficient and rather tedious. Computers don't mind tedium, but
          inefficiency can be a problem. This is where a trie comes into play.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine that I give you the word <i>and</i> on a piece of paper and
          tell you to put it inside of a magic folder. Once you open the folder,
          you're surprised to find 26 other folders, labeled <b>A</b> through
          <b>Z</b>. Since our word is <i>and</i>, we put it into the
          <b>A</b> folder. But once we open the <b>A</b> folder, we find that
          there are another set of folders labeled <b>A</b> through <b>Z</b>.
          What folder do we put our word into now?
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we already are in the <b>A</b> folder, it doesn't make sense to
          put this word into another <b>A</b> folder. Instead, we move on to the
          second letter of <i>and</i>, <b>N</b> how exciting! But as you might
          have guessed, inside the <b>N</b> folder, we have another set of
          folders inside. Within that, we move into the <b>D</b> folder. At this
          point, we have run out of letters, so we put our word inside. The path
          looks like this: Magic Folder -> A Folder -> N Folder -> D Folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you click on the <i>populate trie</i> button below, each word in
          the 10,000 list I gave you earlier is placed into the magic folder.
          Now if I ask you to find the word <i>scholar</i>, it's much easier.
          You start by opening the <b>S</b> folder. Within that, you open the
          <b>C</b> folder. After that the <b>H</b> folder, and so on until you
          find the word <i>scholar</i>. That was much faster than skimming the
          entire list!
